# Facebook-Fake-Login
This project is based on Servlet, in this project users see a Facebook login page.
That is fake and created by using HTML and CSS that is inserted into the index.jsp file.
If the user login the page using the credential he will find an error in the page i.e., page not found error.
But his login credential is saved into our database and the database is based on my SQL workbench.

Note: This is a project for education purposes only not for any cybercrime i.e., phishing, etc.
